  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert prints text to a pop up, which the user has to click an 'ok' button before continuing. Console prints text to the Javascipt console, which is good for debugging.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Alerts may be good for signaling to the user when something they've entered in a form field is wrong.  It's used to make sure the user gets some information by making them click 'ok' before continuing.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>In the instances we used on this page.  They should be used for important information only.  Alerts should be used sparingly, otherwise the user may get anoyed having to click 'ok' multiple times.</p>
