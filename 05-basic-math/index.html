    <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>

    <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
    <p>The first digits of the string need to be numbers for it to parse any numbers from the string.</p>

    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
    <p>You 'NaN' or 'not a number'.</p>

    <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
    <p>I would use ++ or -- for looping.  For instance, in a game where turns are counted.</p>
