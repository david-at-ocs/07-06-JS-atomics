    <h1>JS Atomic 06E</h1>
    <p>Oops...looks like I was thinking a bit too far ahead and did 6E before even realizing it. :(</p>

    <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
    <p>It does matter what order the if/else statements are in. Once it get to the first true statement, it does the output and leaves the breaks out of the if statement.</p>

    <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>Instead of hard coding each age, you could save them as variable (drivingAge, permitAge, underAge, etc.) so that they can be easily updated without having to go into the code.</p>
