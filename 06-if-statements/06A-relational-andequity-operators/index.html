    <h1>JS Atomic 06A</h1>
    
    <h3>console.log( "5 == '5' is " + (5 == '5') ); //true</h3>
    <p>'==' checks for equal value, regardless of type.</p>
    
    <h3>console.log( "5 == 'five' is " + (5 == 'five') ); //false -- correct</h3>
    <p>Tries and fails (returns false) to equate the number 5 to the string 'five'.</p>
    
    <h3>console.log( "5 == '6' is " + (5 == '6') ); //false -- correct</h3>
    <p>5 doesn't equal 6, even if one is a string.</p>
    
    <h3>console.log( "5 === '5' is " + (5 === '5') ); //false -- correct</h3>
    <p>'===' checks for both equal value and equal type. Since 5 is not the same type as '5', it returns false.</p>
    
    <h3>console.log( "5 == 2 + 3 is " + (5 == 2 + 3) ); //true -- correct</h3>
    <p>Evaluates 2 + 3 as 5 and then equates 5 to 5.</p>
    
    <h3>console.log( "5 == 2 + 3 is " + (5 == 2 + 3) ); //true -- correct</h3>
    <p>Evaluates 2 + 3 as 5 and then equates 5 to 5.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    <h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
    <p>The first digits of the string need to be numbers for it to parse any numbers from the string.</p>

    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
    <p>You 'NaN' or 'not a number'.</p>

    <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
    <p>I would use ++ or -- for looping.  For instance, in a game where turns are counted.</p>
