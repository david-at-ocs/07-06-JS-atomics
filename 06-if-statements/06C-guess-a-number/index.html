    <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
    <p>It works with '==' because the data types don't have to match, only the values.  It doesn't work with '===' because they are not the same data types.</p>

    <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
    <p>You can use both in this case.</p>

    <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
    <p>'==' check to see if the values are the same, without considering if the data types are the same.  '===' checks if both the values are the same and the data types are the same.</p>

    <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
    <p>It probably better to convert it into an integer, so that you can do more stuff to it if needed.</p>
