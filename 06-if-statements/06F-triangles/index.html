    <h1>JS Atomic 06F Triangles</h1>
    <p></p>

    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
    <p>If one of the lengths is input incorrectly and the resulting variable value is NaN, the result is that the program evaluates the lengths as a traingle.  We could ask the user to input another value, but without some kind of while loop, there's no way of ensuring that they'll input a positive integer.  </p>

    <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
    <p>If all three are 0's, it will still (incorrectly) evaluate to a triangle.</p>
