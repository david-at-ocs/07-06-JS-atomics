    <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>

    <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
    <p>The data type of input the user enters is a string, even if the user inputs an integer.</p>

    <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
    <p>The resulting variable holds an empty string</p>

    <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
    <p>I was as descriptive as possible when selecting variable names. I believe my variable names are descriptive enought for someone to understand what information they have.</p>

    <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
    <p>If the question was changed, it would probably make sense to rename the variable.  The order of the questions shouldn't matter if you also keep the proper variable with the proper question.</p>

    <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
    <p>Most websites use forms to collect information in the form of text fields, pull-downs, etc.  Forms are better because you can collect a lot of information at once, without the user having to click 'ok' for each field they need to enter.  Prompt may be better when you need to collect a single, important piece of information, for instance to catch an error from a form input.</p>

    <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
    <p>From what I can tell, it's not possible unless using a Javascript library like jQuery.</p>
