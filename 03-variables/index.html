    <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
    <p>Not sure.  To hold information you'll need at later point. Like maybe in a different page, or to hold information that you'll use when loading a new section of the page you're on? Perhaps to pre-fill in form fields?</p>

    <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
    <p>Using descriptive variables is good for re-examining code that you haven't looked at for a while.  You'll know exactly what 'hairColor' is, but will probably have trouble remembering what 'hc' is for.  Disadvantages would be a lack of convenience(sp?) when typing.  Typing long var names over and over again can take time.</p>

    <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
    <p>Variables may hold information that could be sent to the server, or to other programs (Ruby?) or used to store information in a database?</p>

    <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
    <p>Once you assign a variable, each time you reference the var's name, Javascript knows how to use it.  I don't think you even need to use var when assigning a variable, so I'm not sure why, asside for clarity of reading, you need to use it.</p>

    <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
    <p>If you're still in the same window, the last know value is used (it's still in memory?). If you start a new window, the code still works, but nothing appears where the value of the variable would be.</p>

    <h2>When I declare a variable (at least in Textmate) it's red, but all following variable declarations are white.  Why?</h2>
