    <h1>JS Atomic 08A What's the Password</h1>
    

    <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
    <p>I like for loops because you can do more on one line of code.  It seems for efficent.</p>
    
    <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>It shouldn't matter because you're comparing two strings.</p>
